## Welcome!

This is the official page of the 2022 *Summer School: Raum und Affekt*.

Here you can find [resources](resources.md) that will allow you to make the most of our summer school, as well as the [program](summer_school_program.md), and information on the [corpus](corpus.md) we will use in the several exercises and practice sessions that will be the core of the summer school.
You will also find some recommended readings, which might give you an idea of what Digital Literary Studies are about.

Please also visit [the dedicated page on the ZÃ¼rich Zentralbibliothek website](
https://www.zb.uzh.ch/en/events/summer-school-raum-und-affekt-einfuhrung-ins-text-mining-literarischer-texte?date=408) to read the **abstracts of the plenary sessions** and see more details on the events.

## Get ready

Please take your time to explore the different sections of this webpage, in particular the [resources](resources.md). While it is *not compulsory* to read the material provided here before the start of the summer school, we **highly recommend** that you get an idea of the approaches and tools that are typically used in Digital Humanities to investigate different aspects of literary texts.

In particular, **if you are completely new to R and R Studio** -- for instance if you are asking yourself, *" R what..?!?"* -- we think **it might be very useful for you to start familiarising with these tools** and their interfaces, as you will be using them during most of the Summer School.
Unless you have R and R Studio already on your computer, you will be able to do everything on the free "cloud" version of R Studio, which you can find and access [here](https://rstudio.cloud).

Yes, we will still go through all the basics with you at the beginning of the Summer School, with sessions dedicated almost exclusively to making you at least comfortable with R Studio. Nonetheless, it can be quite overwhelming to "get into" it, all of a sudden, within one morning.

To make the impact a little smoother, we suggest that you go have a look at some of the many existing tutorials offering an introduction to R and R Studio, such as [this (pdf)](resources/R_RStudio_Basics.pdf), or [this (online)](https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html).
You will find more links in the [resources](resources.md) section.

## Help us give you the best experience

The Summer School will help you discover the potential of DH tools and approaches, showing you how a corpus of texts can be used to obtain new insights and perspectives on aspects of literature that are otherwise difficult to identify and examine, with a particular focus on the analysis of literary affect and space.

**Please remember to fill the [participants' survey](https://forms.gle/hNS1e9JupoZkgmyu7) by June 1st**, which will allow us to customise the summer school based on the participants' experiences and interests.
